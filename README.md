# Git Tutorial With Actions

NOTE: This is a Git repository for demo purpose only!


## GitHub and academic projects

GitHub has a general academic program, which allows promoting your
account to PRO. This eliminates a 100MB limit on repository size and adds some other useful features.


## Integration of a GitHub project with your desktop environment

* I create most content (code, TeX, etc. with Emacs).
* Emacs has Git integration, so most of the common operations on Git repository are a single keystroke operations.
	
* If you do not want to retype credentials every , do this after checkout:

	git config credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3000000'

This is very impor
	
	
#  Python and 'pytest'

If you run 'pytest' or 'python -m pytest' in this folder, functions named test_* in the file test_me.py
will be run.


#  Automation of testing

You use ***GitHub*** feature called 'Actions'. Things to remember:

	* Testing is performed by a virtual machine running an OS, e.g. Ubuntu.
	* One can install software into the OS, to run any kind of code
